## Getting Started

### Prerequisites Check

Before starting, ensure you have:
- [ ] Docker Desktop installed and running
- [ ] Node.js 18+ installed
- [ ] Git installed
- [ ] VS Code or preferred IDE

### Quick Start Commands

1. **Navigate to project directory**:
   ```cmd
   cd "c:\Users\Maverick\Documents\Projects\MERN Stack\Client_Invoice_Management_Portal"
   ```

2. **Start Docker services**:
   ```cmd
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Setup backend**:
   ```cmd
   cd backend
   npm install
   copy .env.example .env
   npm run db:generate
   npm run db:migrate
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Test health endpoint**:
   Open browser to: http://localhost:3001/health

## API Endpoints Available

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register new user
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - User logout
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user

### Clients
- `GET /api/clients` - Get all clients
- `GET /api/clients/:id` - Get single client
- `POST /api/clients` - Create new client
- `PUT /api/clients/:id` - Update client
- `DELETE /api/clients/:id` - Delete client

### Projects
- `GET /api/projects` - Get all projects
- `GET /api/projects/:id` - Get single project
- `GET /api/projects/client/:clientId` - Get projects by client
- `POST /api/projects` - Create new project
- `PUT /api/projects/:id` - Update project
- `DELETE /api/projects/:id` - Delete project

### Time Entries

## Database Schema

### Tables Created:
1. **users** - User accounts and company information
2. **clients** - Client contact information
3. **projects** - Project details and hourly rates
4. **time_entries** - Time tracking records
5. **invoices** - Invoice headers
6. **invoice_items** - Invoice line items

### Relationships:
- Users â†’ Clients (one-to-many)
- Clients â†’ Projects (one-to-many)
- Projects â†’ Time Entries (one-to-many)
- Clients â†’ Invoices (one-to-many)
- Invoices â†’ Invoice Items (one-to-many)

## Development Workflow

### Daily Development Process:
1. Start Docker services: `docker-compose up -d`
2. Start backend: `cd backend && npm run dev`
3. Run tests: `npm test`
4. Check logs: `docker-compose logs`
5. Commit changes: `git add . && git commit -m "description"`

### Testing Workflow:
1. Run unit tests: `npm test`
2. Test API endpoints with tools like Postman or curl
3. Check database with Drizzle Studio: `npm run db:studio`
4. Verify Docker containers: `docker-compose ps`

## Environment Variables Required

Create `.env` file in backend directory with:
```env
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3001
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password123@localhost:5432/invoice_portal
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
SESSION_SECRET=your-super-secret-session-key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_stripe_key
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your_sendgrid_key
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourcompany.com
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## Next Phase Instructions

After completing Phase 1 setup, proceed to Phase 2:
1. Verify all Docker containers are running
2. Test database connections
3. Run initial backend tests
4. Begin frontend React project setup

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Docker containers not starting**: Check Docker Desktop is running
2. **Database connection errors**: Verify PostgreSQL container status
3. **Port conflicts**: Change ports in docker-compose.yml if needed
4. **npm install errors**: Clear node_modules and package-lock.json, reinstall

### Getting Help:
- Check logs: `docker-compose logs [service]`
- Restart services: `docker-compose restart`
- Reset database: `docker-compose down -v && docker-compose up -d`

## Security Considerations

- Environment variables are not committed to git
- Sessions use secure cookies in production
- SQL injection prevention with Drizzle ORM
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Rate limiting implemented
- CORS properly configured
