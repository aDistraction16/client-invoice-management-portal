**"SMA PH NewCo" Client & Invoice Management Portal 9-Step Project Plan**

1. **Goal:** Create a secure, user-friendly SaaS platform for SMA PH NewCo, Inc.'s business clients to manage client information, track project hours, and generate/send invoices. Success will be measured by client adoption and efficient invoice management.  
2. **User Stories:**  
   * As a small business owner, I can securely log in to my dashboard.  
   * As a small business owner, I can add, edit, and view client information.  
   * As a small business owner, I can track and log hours for different projects.  
   * As a small business owner, I can generate and send professional invoices to my clients.  
   * As a small business owner, I can integrate Stripe to receive payments directly through the portal.  
   * As a small business owner, I can set up automatic email reminders for outstanding invoices via SendGrid.  
   * As a small business owner, I can generate and download monthly revenue summary reports in PDF format.  
   * As a client, I can receive and view invoices via email.  
   * As a client, I can pay my invoices securely through the portal using Stripe.  
3. **Data Models:**  
   * **Users:** (id, email, password\_hash, company\_name, contact\_person)  
   * **Clients:** (id, user\_id, client\_name, contact\_person, email, address, phone\_number)  
   * **Projects:** (id, client\_id, project\_name, description, hourly\_rate, status)  
   * **Time Entries:** (id, project\_id, user\_id, date, hours\_logged, description)  
   * **Invoices:** (id, client\_id, user\_id, invoice\_number, issue\_date, due\_date, total\_amount, status, payment\_link)  
   * **Invoice Items:** (id, invoice\_id, description, quantity, unit\_price, total)  
   * **Relationships:** Users have many Clients, Clients have many Projects, Projects have many Time Entries, Clients have many Invoices, Invoices have many Invoice Items.  
5. **MVP:** The absolute must-have features for the first version include:  
   * Secure user authentication (login, logout, registration).  
   * Client management (add, view, edit).  
   * Project tracking (add, view, edit, associate with clients).  
   * Time entry logging.  
   * Basic invoice generation and sending (without advanced email automation).  
   * Invoice status tracking.  
   * Basic dashboard view of clients and outstanding invoices.  
6. **Simple Prototype:** A basic wireframe/mockup would show the login page, a dashboard displaying current clients and open invoices, a client list page with options to add/edit, a project list page, and a simplified invoice creation form.  
7. **Future of Project:** The project is designed for scalability to handle increasing numbers of users, clients, and data. It is a long-term SaaS product with plans for continuous feature additions and improvements beyond the MVP.  
8. **Components:**  
   * **Frontend:** React 18, TypeScript, Material-UI, React Hook Form, TanStack Query.  
   * **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js.  
   * **Database:** PostgreSQL.  
   * **ORM:** Drizzle ORM.  
   * **Authentication:** Session-based authentication (session storage using Redis, secure cookies with HttpOnly and Secure flags, CSRF protection, session expiration and renewal).  
   * **Integrations:** Stripe API, SendGrid API.  
   * **PDF Generation:** A library for server-side PDF generation.  
   * **Development Environment:** VS Code, Git.  
   * **Architecture:** Client-server architecture with a RESTful API.  
9. **Pick Your Stack:**  
   * **Frontend:** React 18 for dynamic UI, TypeScript for type safety, Material-UI for consistent design, React Hook Form for efficient form handling, TanStack Query for server state management.  
   * **Backend:** Node.js and Express.js for a fast and scalable RESTful API.  
   * **Database:** PostgreSQL for robust and scalable relational data storage.  
   * **ORM:** Drizzle ORM for type-safe and efficient database interactions.  
   * **Authentication:** Session-based authentication for secure user logins, with emphasis on secure session management practices.  
   * **Integrations:** Stripe for secure payment processing, SendGrid for reliable email delivery of invoices and reminders.  
   * **PDF Generation:** A suitable Node.js library for creating PDF revenue summaries.  
10. **Overall Development Process:**  
    * **Skeleton:** Initialize Git repository, set up project folders for frontend and backend, configure Node.js and React development environments.  
    * **Database:** Set up PostgreSQL database, define Drizzle ORM schema for Users, Clients, Projects, Time Entries, Invoices, and Invoice Items. Run migrations. Plan for data migration strategies for future schema changes.  
    * **Backend:** Develop RESTful API endpoints for user authentication, CRUD operations for clients, projects, time entries, and invoices. Implement session management and API tests. Focus on robust input validation, comprehensive error handling patterns, and data backup procedures. Incorporate security considerations like rate limiting, input sanitization, and SQL injection prevention.  
    * **Frontend:** Build the user interface (login, dashboard, client management, project tracking, time logging, invoice creation/viewing). Connect UI components to backend API endpoints using TanStack Query.  
    * **Integrations:** Implement Stripe payment integration and SendGrid email sending. Develop the PDF report generation feature.  
    * **Testing Strategy:** Implement unit tests (Jest), integration tests, and end-to-end tests (Cypress). Aim for high code coverage.  
    * **Deployment & DevOps:** Define deployment strategy, considering containerization (Docker) and cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Vercel). Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated builds and deployments. Manage different environments (development, staging, production) with appropriate configurations. Implement monitoring and logging.  
    * **Iteration:** Continuously add features, conduct thorough testing (unit, integration, end-to-end), and deploy iterations to a staging environment for review and feedback before production deployment. A staging environment will also be used for client demos.
